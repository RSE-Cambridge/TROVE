22.12.2014

perturbation.f90: remove undetermined me_t for iclass=Nlcass
me_t(iprim,jprim) = me_t(iprim,jprim)*Hobject(nu_i(PT%Nmodes),nu_j(PT%Nmodes)) ->
me_t(iprim,jprim) = Hobject(nu_i(PT%Nmodes),nu_j(PT%Nmodes))

perturbation.f90: Andrey's method of transforming to the contracted  by classes first and only then making the product of classes 
to obtain the contracted matrix. Hopefully this will resolve the mane  bottle neck. The on-the-fly-method was replaced by 
precomputing and storing matrix elements. 

28.07.2014
perturbation.f90: added iroot_in in the prediagonaliztion step in order to resolve the problem with clusters, when there were
wrong states included into the symm-dependent group and fixed this situation. 

28.07.2014
perturbation.f90: "Non-diagonal element between different symmetries is too large", remove this conditional stop 
                  for linear molecules if any of gamma>4, i.e. E symmetry. 

28.07.2014
perturbation.f90: Test PThamiltonianMat_contracted_reduced, activated

29.07.2014
perturbation.f90: option postprocees is added for PThamiltonianMat_contracted_reduced

23.02.2015
Current D2h(M) was not working with H2O2 and was replaced with the previous version from 10.09.2013. 
The no-euler is still not working although was ok in Feb 2013. 

23.02.2015
The bug in the vib-splting section was fixed. 

28.02.2015
 - The new ZMAT type x,y (103) is implemented to be used with linear coordinates
 - no-diagonalization is simplified but reducing the memory requirement when constructing and diagonalizing the matrix 
   and optimizing the dipoles. 

03.03.2015
 - dipole: the parallelization inside the main ilevelF loop changed to parallelization of ilevelF

07.03.2015

27.03.2015
 AMES1 dipole for SO2 implemented

24.04.2015 
 C(M) treatment in contr_prediag is simplyfied, symmetry is A.

15.05.2015
The vibrational angular momentum is implemented for the Harmmonic basis:
The reduced problem solved for the reduced Hamiltonian is then post-processed
by diaogonalizing the Lz^2 matrix for the degenerate states only. 
This procedure can be invoked by the new keyword vib_momentum. 

The vib-angular momenta can be controlled by NVibmomentum X, where X  is the largest value. 

16.05.2015
A new PES for C2H2 based on the 7-coordinates is implemented.

21.09.2015
 contr_descr writing bug for Lvib is fixed

22.11.2015
 Added print_poten and print_kinetic also when the poten or kinetic fields are READ
 Added a kinetic_skip to skip the kinetic part in hamltonian.chk in order to allow POTEN READ AND KINETIC NONE/SAVE

29.12,2015

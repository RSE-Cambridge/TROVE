pot_xy2 : new PES h2s_dvr3d
fileds : vib-rot only with split 
pot_abcd : a number of implementations for linear molecule C2H2 

22.12.2014
mol_abcd: symmetry for C2H2 to be the same as E and E' (5 and 6)

perturbation.f90: remove undetermined me_t for iclass=Nlcass
me_t(iprim,jprim) = me_t(iprim,jprim)*Hobject(nu_i(PT%Nmodes),nu_j(PT%Nmodes)) ->
me_t(iprim,jprim) = Hobject(nu_i(PT%Nmodes),nu_j(PT%Nmodes))

perturbation.f90: Andrey's method of transforming to the contracted  by classes first and only then making the product of classes 
to obtain the contracted matrix. Hopefully this will resolve the mane  bottle neck. The on-the-fly-method was replaced by 
precomputing and storing matrix elements. 

28.07.2014
perturbation.f90: added iroot_in in the prediagonaliztion step in order to resolve the problem with clusters, when there were
wrong states included into the symm-dependent group and fixed this situation. 

28.07.2014
perturbation.f90: "Non-diagonal element between different symmetries is too large", remove this conditional stop 
                  for linear molecules if any of gamma>4, i.e. E symmetry.

perturbation.f90: Test PThamiltonianMat_contracted_reduced, activated

29.07.2014
perturbation.f90: option postprocees is added for PThamiltonianMat_contracted_reduced

23.02.2015
Current D2h(M) was not working with H2O2 and was replaced with the previous version from 10.09.2013. 
The no-euler is still not working although was ok in Feb 2013. 

23.02.2015
The bug in the vib-splting section was fixed. 

28.02.2015
 - The new ZMAT type x,y (103) is implemented to be used with linear coordinates
 - no-diagonalization is simplified but reducing the memory requirement when constructing and diagonalizing the matrix 
   and optimizing the dipoles. 

03.03.2015
 - dipole: the parallelization inside the main ilevelF loop changed to parallelization of ilevelF

07.03.2015
 - change to my_fmt to avoid openmp segm. faults

13.03.2015
 - Started programming Dnh for n even. The n=2 case seems to be working for C2H2

21.03.2015
 - D4h is working, but D6-8h not

27.03.2015
 AMES1 dipole for SO2 implemented

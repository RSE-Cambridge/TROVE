The vibrational angular momentum is implemented for the Harmmonic basis:
The reduced problem solved for the reduced Hamiltonian is then post-processed
by diaogonalizing the Lz^2 matrix for the degenerate states only. 

This procedure can be invoked by the new keyword vib_momentum. 

The vib-angular momenta can be controlled by NVibmomentum X, where X  is the largest value.
